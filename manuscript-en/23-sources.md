# Sources and References

My opinion of modern development and good code has been influenced by other people's work. In this appendix, I have prepared a list of books, articles, talks, methodologies, and studies that I find most useful and refer to in my own work.

Each section in this list has a title similar to the chapter topics. If you are interested in the topic of a particular chapter and want to know more, the sections in the list will help you navigate more easily among the links.

The links can repeat. I decided it was more important to compile a complete list for each topic than to get rid of duplicates. I hope you find this useful.

## Notion of Refactoring and Code Quality

What refactoring is and why it is needed. What an uncontrollably increasing complexity of a project can lead to. How to define “bad” and “good” code.
