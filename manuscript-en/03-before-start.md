# Before Refactoring

To refactor code faster, without regressions, and without ‚Äútoo much extra work,‚Äù we need to first _study and prepare_ the code. In particular, we should:

- Define the refactoring scope and boundaries.
- Cover the code under refactoring with tests.
- Configure linters and, if needed, the compiler more strictly.

In this chapter, we'll discuss why these steps are helpful and how to make them simpler.

## Define Scope and Boundaries

Refactoring should not take forever. Instead, it should be a little chunk of work with clear boundaries and a definition of done. It's essential for two reasons:

- We want to stay within our _time and resource budget_.
- Limited changes are _easier to keep track of_ to see faster if they break the app.

Refactoring boundaries define the scope of work. They are the junction points between the code we're going to change and everything else. They show where our changes should stop, that is, what code _won't_ change.

Defining boundaries in the code isn't always obvious, especially if the modules are tightly coupled. In such cases, we should pay attention to the code's _data and dependencies_.

The more different the data two pieces of code work with, the more likely they are different, independent parts of the program. The junction of these pieces is the boundary that should prevent changes from spreading across the code base.

| Feathers in ‚ÄúWorking Effectively with Legacy Code‚Äù calls these junctions ‚Äúseams.‚Äù[^workingeffectively] Sometimes, I will use this term as a synonym. |

Boundaries prevent refactoring from taking forever and help you integrate changes into the repository's main branch more often.

| In detail üî¨                                                                           |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| We'll talk a little more about finding and using boundaries in the following chapters. |

## Cover with Tests

We need to cover the code inside the boundaries with tests. We'll use them to check if something was broken during refactoring constantly. To make more use of the tests, we should meet several conditions:

### Find More Edge Cases

Edge cases help avoid regressions and ensure we haven't broken the code behavior in ‚Äúexotic‚Äù circumstances. (‚ÄúExotic‚Äù bugs are much harder to fix.[^debugit])

The more diverse the edge cases, the easier it is to prepare and systematize test data for different situations. The knowledge of the application's behavior in these situations will come in handy in the future, even after refactoring.

### Define Explicit and Implicit Input

The explicit input is the arguments of functions or methods. The implicit input is dependencies, shared or global state, and the context of functions and methods. Systematization of input data will simplify test case creation.

### Specify Desired Result

During refactoring, we can't change the code functionality, so the desired result is the actual current behavior of the program. We can capture it as output data (e.g., the result of a function) or as a desired side effect (e.g., state change or API call).

Ideally, the result should exist _on the boundary_ of code under refactoring. Checking results on the boundary is easier, while the amount of affected code is minimal.

### Set Up Automatic Tests

When refactoring, we want to test _every_ change, even a minuscule one. Manual testing can get tiresome. We might get lazy or forget to test the changes with manual testing.

Automatic tests don't have this problem. They can run in parallel while refactoring and re-test the code each time we save a file. That way, the test results are always in front of our eyes, and we can notice faster what change has broken the code.

What type of tests to use depends on the situation and isn't as important as their existence. If unit tests are enough, we can use only them. If we have to test the work of several modules, we may need an integration or E2E test. The main point here is _automation_. The fewer checks we do by hand, the fewer human errors appear.

## Make Linter and Compiler Settings Stricter

This section is somewhat optional, but I like using it. In my opinion, more aggressive linter and compiler settings help spot occasional bugs and bad practices. ‚ÄúMore aggressive‚Äù settings can include:

### Use ‚ÄúErrors‚Äù Instead of ‚ÄúWarnings‚Äù

Linter warnings are a collective experience of the industry. They can be valuable, but they're easy to miss because they don't make the code compilation ‚Äúcrash with an error.‚Äù

With errors, on the other hand, the code ‚Äúwon't compile.‚Äù Errors will force us to update the code or change our linter rules.

| Keep in mind ‚ùóÔ∏è                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Not all linter rules are equally helpful. We can choose rules that we think are more important and discard others. However, once we have selected a set of rules, we should follow them strictly. |

### Configure More Automated Checks

It is a great time to try out new linter rules or other automated tools if the team wants to try them out.

But it's worth remembering that not all rules are equally valuable and appropriate for every project. We should try not to go against the team. If most of the other developers in the team think a particular linter rule is unnecessary, we shouldn't introduce it.

Teams can debate rules and practices to determine the most suitable for them. But remember that no rule is worth having a conflict in the team.
