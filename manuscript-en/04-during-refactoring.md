# During Refactoring

After we've defined clear boundaries, examined the code, and covered it with tests, we can start refactoring.

As we work, we want the changes to be as helpful as possible while staying within our boundaries. In this chapter, we'll discuss heuristics that help us do this.

## Small Steps

A small step is a minimal change that makes sense. An excellent example of a small step is an _atomic commit_.[^atomic] Such a commit contains a meaningful functionality change and evolves the code from one working state to another. We can develop and change the code base with atomic commits while keeping it valid at every point.

| Atomic commits allow us to bisect the repository in the future while searching for bugs.[^bisect][^bettercommits] When code is valid and can compile in each of the commits, we can ‚Äútime travel‚Äù through the repository by switching between different commits. |

The size of commits depends on the habits and preferences of the team. Personally, my rule of thumb is ‚Äúthe smaller the commit, the better.‚Äù For example, I commit separately even function and variable renames on my projects.

Smaller steps encourage us to decompose tasks into simpler ones. This way, extensive features turn into sets of compact tasks, which are not so scary to merge into the main repository branch more often. Without decomposition, such a task could turn into a blocker that drags the whole team down.

| :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The point of _continuous integration, CI_ is for the team to synchronize code changes with each other as often as possible. This approach and its benefits are described well in ‚ÄúCode That Fits in Your Head‚Äù by Mark Seemann and ‚ÄúBeyond Legacy Code‚Äù by Scott Bernstein.[^codethatfits][^beyond] |

Blocking tasks should be avoided in general, but especially when refactoring code. If the whole team is busy with refactoring, it can become expensive. The precedent of being expensive can deprive the project of resources for refactoring at all in the future.

In addition, small steps allow us to ‚Äúpostpone‚Äù refactoring at any time and switch to another task. If we work with git, we can use ‚Äústash‚Äù to save unfinished work via `git stash`. That way, the developers become more flexible and respond faster to sudden bugs and other problems.

Also, the results of small steps are easier to check and evaluate before committing. Such checks help us filter out changes that are not relevant to the current task. For example, they can help us spot accidental changes caused by automated formatters or linters.

And lastly, small steps are easier to describe in commit messages. The scope of such changes is less, so it is easier to explain their meaning in a short sentence.

## Small but Detailed Pull Requests

This section follows the previous one, but I want to focus on it separately. The problem with big pull requests is that:

---

**‚ùóÔ∏è No one reviews big pull requests**

---

If we want to _improve_ the code, we need the pull request to _be reviewed_. So our job is to make the reviewer's job easier. To do this, we can:

- Limit the size of changes. So it's easier to find time for a review and understand the PR's goals and meaning. This way, the code review won't look like a big chunk of new work.
- Describe the context of the task in the message to the PR. The reasons, goals, and constraints of the task will help share the understanding of the task with the reviewer. This way, we can anticipate likely questions and answer them in advance. It will speed up the review.

The desire for small but detailed PR also helps break down large tasks into smaller ones and refactor them in small steps.

## Tests for Every Change

For the code to evolve through valid states, we will test _every_ change, no matter how small.

When using unit tests, we can keep them running next to the editor. When using longer-running tests (like E2E), we can run them before each commit (e.g., on a pre-commit hook) so that invalid code doesn't get into the repository.

The tests should drive us to _commit only valid code_. Each commit will contain a set of _complete and meaningful_ changes.

| By the way üß™                                                                                                                                                                        |
| :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| It will only work if tests are trustworthy. That's why we emphasized edge cases and detailed specifications of the result in the latest chapter. That help make tests more reliable. |

## One Technique at a Time

Frequent commits are anchor points in code evolution. The more frequent such points are, the more compact the changes in between. It is useful, for example, when examining changes from the latest commit we just made. Small changes are faster to study, easier to understand, and contain less work, so it's emotionally easier to roll them back in case we need to.

During refactoring, though, it's not always obvious how to make changes smaller and more often. I prefer to follow this rule:

---

**‚ùóÔ∏è Don't mix different refactoring techniques in the same commit**

---

This rule makes us commit code more often: we renamed a function‚Äîmade a commit, extracted a variable‚Äîmade a commit, added code for a future replacement‚Äîmade a commit, and so on.

As long as we don't mix different techniques in one commit, it's easier for us to track code changes by diffs and find errors like name conflicts.

Complex techniques that are too big for a single commit can be broken up into steps. We can commit each of these steps separately. But when splitting the task, we should remember that each step must leave the code in a valid state.

| By the way üëÄ                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Such a combination of atomic commits, continuous integration, and checks before committing changes is sometimes called the ‚Äútactical‚Äù git.[^tacticalgit] We will occasionally use this term later as well. |

## No Features, No Bug Fixes

During refactoring, we may find an idea for a feature or a piece of code that doesn't work correctly. We may want to ‚Äúfix it along the way,‚Äù but it's better not to mix bug fixes and new features with refactoring.

Refactoring _should not_ change the code functionality. If, during refactoring, we add a feature, and later it needs to be rolled back, we'll have to cherry-pick specific commits or even lines of code into the repo manually.

Instead, it's better to put all the found feature ideas into a separate list and return to them after refactoring. If we find a bug, we should postpone refactoring (`git stash`) and return to it after the fix. Again, working in small steps is more convenient for this maneuverability.

## Transformation Priority Premise

_Transformation Priority Premise, TPP_ is a list of actions that help develop code from the naive, most straightforward implementation to a more complex one that meets all the project requirements.[^tpp]

TPP helps _avoid doing everything at once_. It encourages us to gradually update a piece of code, recording each step in the version control system, and integrating changes into the main repository branch more often.

For me, TPP helps me not overload my head with details while writing code. All improvement ideas that come up along the way, I put in a separate list. I then compare this list with TPP and choose what to implement next.

| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ‚ÄúOffloaded‚Äù details free up the brain's ‚Äúworking memory.‚Äù[^shorttermmemory] The freed resources can be spent on the task details. They will improve attentiveness and focus. |

## Refactoring Tests Separately

Tests and the application code cover each other. Tests verify that we haven't made mistakes in the application code and vice versa. If we refactor them simultaneously, the probability of missing a bug becomes higher.

It's better to refactor the application code and test code one at a time. If, while refactoring an application, we notice that we need to refactor a test, we should:

- Stash the application code changes;
- Refactor the desired test;
- Verify that the test breaks for a reason it should;
- Get the last changes from the stash and continue working on them.
