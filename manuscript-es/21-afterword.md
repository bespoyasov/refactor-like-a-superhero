## For Publishers

This book is a large draft of a book on refactoring that I would like to write in the future.

In the future book, I would like to combine fragmented code examples into a single application. It would help to show how to refactor not various pieces of code but whole projects. In my opinion, it would be more demonstrative and helpful.

Refactoring such a project would cover all the techniques mentioned in this book combined under the shared context of a single application. It would make it possible to see how the different refactoring techniques support each other and help work toward a common result.

If you'd like to publish such a book, please, contact me by mail.[^email] I'd be happy to discuss the details!

## For Translators
